The Shop needs to slide in and out from the right side from the toggle button

Items in the shop need to be able to be added and removed/replaced. I think slot numbers would work best and an item id chart would work best.
example:
1 = "item_token_everliving" in slot_1
2 = "item_team_revive_item" in slot_14
etc....

Items need to show tooltips and display gold/karma cost (yellow/blue)

Shop needs to be able to be disabled/enabled by the server for inbetween rounds. Button Should change color when disabled

When an item is bought an event needs to return the item and cost

The four "Boss Loot" slots need to disapear on purchase

The "General" and "Scolls" slots need to be able to hold up to 12 slots each
The "Boss Loot" will always have 4 slots

"General" slots 1 - 12
"Scolls" slots 13 - 24
"Boss Loot" slots 25 - 28
